# Deep-Eye: Automatic Image Captioning Application for visually impaired people (with Deep Learning)
# Introduction
The “Deep Eye” project is an innovative and cutting-edge system that leverages deep
learning techniques to provide image captioning capabilities. It aims to bridge the gap
between computer vision and natural language processing by automatically generating
descriptive captions for images. This project holds significant potential in various domains,
including assistive technology, content indexing, and enhancing user experiences with
image-based applications.
